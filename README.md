# FFA Hash

The Flip Flop Algorithm (FFA) Hash is a hash which was designed by RoyzerM in a week for fun. It was made by a young teenager who is an encryption and hashing enthusiast, meaning it probably won't be as effective as for example - MD5 or SHA! If you are planning to use this for important documents, you'd be better off using one of the more known hashing algorithms.

# Guide

1. Open "Packages.py" to ensure you have the required modules installed.

2. "Packages.py" automatically opens "Hash.exe" as a follow up to downloading the packages.

3. Input an ASCII string you desire to be hashed!

# Notes

- Keep in mind that once you have opened up "Packages.py", you may delete it since you've already installed the required packages.
- Windows Defender flags this folder and will run a scan since the "Hash.exe" file has been obfuscated. Windows Defender shouldn't end up removing the folder upon installation.
